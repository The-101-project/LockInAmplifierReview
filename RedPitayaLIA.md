> ... In this article, we detail an LIA which we have implemented on the STEMlabâ€™s FPGA chip, along with open source29 operational and data transfer software developed specifically for this application. We demonstrate that this device shares many capabilities with more expensive alternatives such as a sweepable internal signal generator, single or dual input/output modes, wave form control, and the ability to increase the number of available inputs and outputs by interfacing across multiple STEMlab units. ...
